<h2>Home Page: Introduction to Robotics and Its Applications</h2>
<p1>Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that merges engineering, computer science, and technology to create
    machines capable of performing various tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These robots are often
    programmed to perform specific tasks, such as assembling products on a factory line, assisting in surgeries, or
    even exploring distant planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities for industries, healthcare, exploration,
    and personal use, leading to innovation in sectors that previously relied heavily on manual labor.
</p1>
<p>In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technologies have greatly
    enhanced the capabilities of robots. They are no longer just machines following preset instructions, but
    autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and interacting with their environment. From robotic arms in
    manufacturing to drones in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving and has become a critical part
    of modern society.</p>

<h2>Robots in Industry: Key Advancements in Industrial Automation</h2>
<p>Robots are revolutionizing industrial sectors by automating processes that previously required human labor. The
    most common types of industrial robots include robotic arms, which are widely used in the automotive,
    electronics, and consumer goods industries. These machines can perform tasks with precision, speed, and
    endurance beyond human capabilities, such as welding, painting, assembling, and packaging.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing production time and costs, industrial robots can work in hazardous environments where
    human safety might be at risk, such as in handling toxic materials or working in extreme temperatures. As the
    demand for mass production grows, robots are becoming essential for maintaining the pace and quality required in
    modern manufacturing. The future of industrial robots includes increased collaboration between robots and
    humans, with robots assisting workers in complex tasks that require high-level decision-making.</p>

    Humanoid Robots: Overview of Humanoid Robots and Their Capabilities
    Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble and mimic human behavior, both in appearance and functionality.
    These robots are capable of performing tasks traditionally reserved for humans, such as assisting in healthcare,
    customer service, and education. The defining characteristic of humanoid robots is their ability to interact with
    humans in a natural and intuitive way, using advanced algorithms for speech recognition, facial expression
    interpretation, and decision-making.</p>

    <p>
    Some of the most well-known humanoid robots include robots like ASIMO, Sophia, and Atlas, which have been designed
    for various purposes, from assisting the elderly and disabled to performing dangerous tasks in disaster-stricken
    areas. Humanoid robots are also becoming an integral part of research and development, where they help scientists
    better understand human cognition, biomechanics, and social interaction. With continued advancements in artificial
    intelligence and robotics, humanoid robots are expected to become more autonomous, capable of learning from
    experience, and performing increasingly complex tasks in the future.</p>
